Problem Description

You are given three numbers a, b and c as arguments. You have to implement the function isDescending that will return true only if the first number is greater than the second number AND the second number is greater than the third number. Else, return false.
   Hint: This is a combination of comparison operator and logical operator.

 ----- Sample Input
        10, 9, 7

------Sample Output
        true
Explanation
True, since 10 is greater than 9 and 9 is greater than 7.

  ____________Case operator for Code_______________

  /**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @param {number} c
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function isDescending(a, b, c) {
    // You only need to implement this function.
    // CRIO_SOLUTION_START_MODULE_ES6_FOUNDATIONS
    
     return (a > b) && (b > c);
   
    // CRIO_SOLUTION_END_MODULE_ES6_FOUNDATIONS
}

if (isDescending(3, 2, 1) !== true)
    console.log("Test fails: Expected true for input a = 3, b = 2 and c = 3");
else
    console.log("Sample test cases for input a = 3, b = 2 and c = 1 passed!");

module.exports = isDescending;
